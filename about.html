		<h1>About the Recipe Book Project</h1>

		<p>I have a long and complicated history with cooking. And by that I mean I am often not allowed to do it without adult supervison! (i suffer from a condition called being stupid disorder) but trust me, i can make a KILLER pb&j sandwich if given the chance. I enjoyed baking with my mom as a small child (when i could eat the muffin batter) but now i'm old enough to mix raw eggs and flour and eat it all by myself like a big boy.</p>
